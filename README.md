## What is React js?

React.js (often just called React) is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications (SPAs) where you need a responsive, dynamic, and interactive experience. It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by Facebook, Instagram, and a large community of developers.

### Key Features:

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Components can be either class-based or functional.
- **Declarative Syntax:**React uses a declarative approach to describe how the UI should look based on the state of the application.
- **irtual DOM:** React creates a virtual representation of the real DOM, which helps optimize and improve rendering performance.
- **JSX Syntax:** React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript code.


## How to Set Up React JS?
### Prerequisite Apps
Before installing React JS, you need to have the following software installed on your system:
- **Node.js**: React relies on Node.js for package management (NPM/Yarn). You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Code Editor**: A good code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended for React development.
### Step-by-Step Installation
1. **Install Node.js and NPM**
   - Download and install Node.js from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Verify installation:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
2. **Create a New React Application**
   - Open your terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app my-custom-react-app
     ```
   - This command creates a new React project named `my-custom-react-app`. It installs all necessary dependencies and sets up the project structure.
3. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd my-custom-react-app
